**A coming of age feature film about three best friends surviving their last year of high school**

<!--more-->

> In the once quiet school library at St Marks College, Zane, James and Mitch are met head-on with the challenges of their final school year. Against-the-grain bad boy Zane becomes obsessed with Becca, the new girl at school. The more laid back James is being leaned on by Beth, his long term girlfriend, who wants him to take a little responsibility over his life. And Mitch is just trying to lose his virginity, but in the process becomes involved with Tilly, the most popular girl in school. Written by Pancake Originals

The Library Boys is due for release soon.
