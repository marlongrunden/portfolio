Modern, unique Library music

<!--more-->

[Amity Music Library](https://amity.media/) produces high quality, instantly usable production and library music for all kinds of genres and moods. Based in London, Amity works with talented composers and engineers to create top notch audio content. I've had the pleasure of working with them on several releases such as _Clock Watching Tension, Piano Patterns, Minimal Pulsing Synths and Horror Beds_. Amity Music Library is distributed internationally through (Bam Music)[https://www.bammusic.com/intl], and in Australia through [BeatBox Music](https://www.newbeatbox.com/)
