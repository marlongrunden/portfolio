_Pastels_ Lo-Fi track "looking Back" for 823 Records' "All Things Considered, Vol. 1" compilation

<!--more-->

[Pastels'](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FMHJYjF4SBeWszMXgWoaR) music is as beautiful as it is melancholy, and crosses genres like Jazz, Lounge and Lo-Fi Hip Hop. I always love mixing her music, and this track was no different. This particular compilation is also full of incredible artists such as Ta-Ku, Wun Two, and Jinsang
